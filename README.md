# Functional analysis

These are the syllabus, course notes and homework for a reading course in functional analysis taught at the University of Iceland in the fall of 2023.

## Talk to someone

This is a reading course so we won't have as much face-to-face interaction as you might be used to.
Therefore, **do not hesitate** to contact me with any questions you have about the course material.
My contact information is below.
I also encourage you to discuss the material with the other students in the course.
If you want we can make a Discord server (or something) to discuss coursework during the week.

## Topics

At first we will cover the basic topics in functional analysis:

- Banach spaces
- The Hahn-Banach theorem
- The uniform boundedness principle
- The open image theorem
- The closed graph theorem

We will then agree on further topics to cover. Some options are:

- Hilbert spaces
- Fourier analysis
- Distribution theory
- Dual spaces
- Operator theory
- Spectral theory

I personally enjoy Hilbert spaces and applications to partial differential equations and geometry, but we will decide together what to cover.

## Literature

I haven't decided on a main book to follow yet.
Some candidates are:

- Peter D. Lax, _Functional analysis_.
- Walter Rudin, _Functional analysis_.
- John B. Conway, _A course in functional analysis_.

If you have other options we'll look at them.

I'll keep an eye out for survey articles, historical notes, and related material and add them here.
As an example:

- Jean Dieudonn√©, _History of functional analysis_.
- Garrett Birkhoff, _[The establishment of functional analysis](https://home.agh.edu.pl/~rudol/History_of_F_A_beginings.pdf)_.
- Carcassi, Calderon, Aidala,
_[The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06669)_.


I think it's important to know the context for problems and techniques, but this is supplementary material and you don't have to read it to pass the course.

## Homework

There will be weekly homework problems.
They will be graded and will contribute to your final grade for the course.
You are allowed to collaborate on the homework problems, just note that you did so on your solution.

There will be a final exam of some sort.
We can agree on the details together.

We will follow the academic calendar like the rest of the university.
In particular our last session will be in the week of November 17th to 24th, with the final exam between November 27th and December 11th.
