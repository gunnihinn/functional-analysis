A \emph{metrizable vector space} is a vector space $V$ that is
equipped with a metric $d$ for which the addition map $(x, y) \mapsto x +
y$ and multiplication map $(\lambda, x) \mapsto \lambda x$ are continuous.
We suppose here that $V$ is defined over a field $k$ such that $\kk R \subset k$
(for example, the real or complex numbers.


\begin{prob}
Let $T_a(x) = x + a$ and $M_\lambda(x) = \lambda x$ for $a \in V$ and $\lambda
\in k$.
Show that $T_a$ and $M_\lambda$ are homeomorphisms of $V$ with itself; that is,
they are continuous maps that have a continuous inverse.
\end{prob}


\begin{proof}[Solution]
The restriction of a continuous function to a subspace is continuous.
If $p(x,y) = x+y$ is the addition map then $T_a$ is its restriction to
$\{(x,a) \in V \times V \mid x \in V \}$, so $T_a$ is continuous.
The inverse of $T_a$ is $T_{-a}$, which is also continuous, so it is a
homeomorphism.

Similarly $M_\lambda$ is the restriction of the multiplication map to
$\{(\lambda, x) \in k \times V \mid x \in V \}$, so it is continuous.
(We have to assume there's a metric also on $k$ we can use, so let's do that.)
If $\lambda\not=0$ the inverse of $M_{\lambda}$ is $M_{1/\lambda}$, which is
also continuous.
\end{proof}


\begin{prob}
Let $V$ and $W$ be metrizable vector spaces and $f : V \to W$ a linear map.
Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if it is continuous at $0$.
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
If $f$ is continuous it is clearly continuous at $0$.

Suppose then that $f$ is continuous at $0$ and let's show it is continuous at $x$.
A function on a metric space is continuous at $x$ if and only if $f(x_n) \to f(x)$
for every sequence $(x_n)$ that converges to $x$.
If $(x_n)$ is a sequence that converges to $x$, then $(x_n-x)$ is a sequence
that converges to $0$, and
\[
f(x_n) - f(x)
= f(x_n - x)
\to 0
\]
by linearity and continuity at $0$, so $f(x_n) \to f(x)$.
\end{proof}

A subset $E \subset V$ of a metrizable vector space is \emph{bounded} if for
any neighborhood $U$ of $0$ there exists a $\lambda > 0$ such that $E
\subset \mu U$ for any $\mu \geq \lambda$.

Note that this is \emph{not} the same notion of boundedness we get from the
metric on $V$; it can be defined if we only have a topology and not a metric.
Sets can be bounded in one notion and not the other.


\begin{prob}
Let $U$ be an open set that contains $0$.
Let $(r_j)$ be an increasing sequence of positive real numbers such that $r_j
\to \infty$. Show that $V = \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty r_j U$.
Conclude that if $K \subset V$ is compact, then $K$ is bounded.
\end{prob}


\begin{proof}[Solution]
Pick $x \in V$.
Multiplication by a scalar is continuous and $0 \cdot x = 0 \in U$,
so there is some $\lambda > 0$ such that $\lambda x \in U$.
If we pick $j$ such that $r_j > 1/\lambda$ then $x \in r_j U$.
Therefore $V = \bigcup_{j=1}^\infty r_j U$.

Let $K \subset V$ be compact and let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $0$.
There exists an $\varepsilon > 0$ such that $0 \in B(\varepsilon) \subset U$.
By the above, $(r_j B(\varepsilon))$ is an open covering of $V$, so it contains
a finite subcover of $K$. Therefore there is an $r > 0$ such that $K \subset r
B(\varepsilon) = B(r \varepsilon)$.
If $\mu \geq r$ then $K \subset B(r \varepsilon) \subset B(\mu \varepsilon)
\subset \mu U$, so $K$ is bounded.
\end{proof}


\begin{prob}
Let $E \subset V$ be a set.
Show that the following are equivalent:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
$E$ is bounded.

\item
If $(x_n)$ is a sequence in $E$ and $(\lambda_n)$ is a sequence of scalars such
that $\lambda_n \to 0$ as $n \to \infty$, then $\lambda_n x_n \to 0$ as $n \to
\infty$.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Suppose first that $E$ is bounded.
Let $(x_n)$ be a sequence in $E$ and let $(\lambda_n)$ be a sequence of
scalars that tends to $0$.
Let $\varepsilon > 0$ and consider $B(\varepsilon)$.
As $E$ is bounded there is a $\lambda > 0$ such that $E \subset \mu B(\varepsilon)$
for every $\mu \geq \lambda$.
There is an $n(\lambda)$ such that $1/\lambda_n \geq \lambda$ for $n \geq n(\lambda)$.
Then $\lambda_n x_n \in B(\varepsilon)$ for all $n \geq n(\lambda)$, so
$\lambda_n x_n \to 0$.

Suppose now that $E$ is not bounded and let $U$ be an open neighborhood of $0$.
For every $n$ there is then an element $x_n \in E \setminus n U$.
But then $(x_n)$ is a sequence of elements in $E$ and $\lambda_n = 1/n$ a
sequence of scalars that tends to zero such that $x_n / n$ does not tend to
$0$, so the sequence condition does not hold.
\end{proof}

A map $f : V \to W$ between metrizable vector spaces is \emph{bounded} if
it maps bounded sets to bounded sets.

\begin{prob}
Let $V$ and $W$ be metrizable vector spaces and $f : V \to W$ a linear map.
Show that if $f$ is continuous then it is bounded.
Find spaces $V$ and $W$ and a linear function $f : V \to W$ that is not continuous.
\end{prob}

\begin{proof}[Solution]
Let $E \subset V$ be a bounded set, let $U \subset W$ be an open
neighborhood of $0$.
As $f$ is continuous and linear, then $f^{-1}(U) \subset V$ is an open
neighborhood of $0$.
Therefore there is a $\lambda > 0$ such that
$E \subset \mu f^{-1}(U)$ for any $\mu \geq \lambda$.
But then $f(E) \subset f(\mu f^{-1}(U)) = \mu f(f^{-1}(U)) = \mu U$
for any $\mu \geq \lambda$
by linearity.

Let $V = W = \cc C^\infty([0,1])$ and let $d(f,g) = \sup_{x \in [0,1]}|f(x)-g(x)|$.
Then $V$ is a metrizable vector space.
Consider the linear map $f \mapsto f'$.
The set $E = \{ e^{-n x} \}_{n \geq 0} \subset V$ is bounded:
Let $U \subset V$ be an open neighborhood around $0$, and let $B(\varepsilon) \subset U$.
We have $d(e^{-nx}, 0) = 1$ for any $n$,
so $E \subset \mu B( \varepsilon ) \subset \mu U$ for any $\mu > 1 / \varepsilon$.

However, let $x_n := (e^{-nx})' = -n e^{-nx}$
define a sequence of points in the image of $E$.
Let $\lambda_n = 1/\sqrt n$.
Then $\lambda_n \to 0$ but
\[
d(\lambda_n x_n, 0) = d(-\sqrt n e^{-nx}, 0) = \sqrt n \to \infty
\]
so $(\lambda_n x_n)$ does not tend to $0$, and the image of $E$ is thus not
bounded.
Therefore the map $f \mapsto f'$ is not continuous.
\end{proof}
