Please select \textbf{three} problems to solve and hand in written solutions
either in person or to \verb+gunnar@magnusson.io+. You may quote problems from
older homework sets and results we've read in the textbook if you feel like
they help.

Recall that in last week's problems we defined a subset $E \subset V$ of a
metrizable vector space to be \emph{bounded} if for any neighborhood $U$ of $0$
there exists a $\lambda > 0$ such that $E \subset \mu U$ for any $\mu \geq
\lambda$.


\begin{prob}
Let $V$ be a normed vector space.
Show that $E \subset V$ is bounded in the metrizable sense
if and only if it is bounded in the usual sense, that is, there exists
$r > 0$ such that $|x| \leq r$ for all $x \in E$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let $V$ be finite-dimensional and let
$| \, \cdot \, |_1$ and
$| \, \cdot \, |_2$ be two norms on $V$.
Show that the norms are equivalent, meaning that there exist constants $c$ and
$C$ such that
\[
c |x|_1 \leq |x|_2 \leq C|x|_1
\]
for all $x \not= 0$.
\end{prob}

A set $E \subset V$ is \emph{convex} if for any $x, y \in E$ the vectors
$\lambda x + (1 - \lambda) y$ are also in $E$ for $0 \leq \lambda \leq 1$.

\begin{prob}
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Show that the unit ball in a normed vector space is convex.

\item
Show that a linear subspace $E \subset V$ is convex.

\item
If $f : V \to W$ is linear and $E \subset V$ is convex, show that $f(E)$ is convex.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let $V$ and $W$ be normed vector spaces and let $f : V \to W$ be linear.
Show that $f$ is continuous if and only if it is bounded, in the sense
that there exists a constant $C > 0$ such that $|f(x)| \leq C |x|$ for all $x$.
\end{prob}

\begin{prob}
Let $V$ be a normed vector space.
\begin{enumerate}
\item
Define $X$ to be the set of Cauchy sequences in $V$.
Show that $X$ may be given the structure of a vector space.

\item
Show that $(x_n) \mapsto \lim_{n \to \infty} |x_n|$ defines a norm on $X$.

\item
Show that the map $f : V \to X$ that sends $x$ to the sequence $(x,x,\ldots)$
is linear, injective, and continuous.

\item
Show that $X$ is complete, and thus a Banach space.
\end{enumerate}
\end{prob}
